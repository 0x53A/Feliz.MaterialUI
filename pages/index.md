# Feliz.MaterialUI

Feliz.MaterialUI provides [Feliz](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz)-style Fable bindings for [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

Current status
--------------

Feliz.MaterialUI is highly usable, but since weâ€™re at `0.x` breaking changes (small or large) may happen at any time. While at `0.x` I will try to increment the minor version for breaking changes and the patch version for anything else. Note that in this context, changes to components from `@material-ui/lab` will never be considered breaking.

Feedback welcome!
-----------------

This project is still rather new. If you have suggestions for API improvements, please open an issue!
